#### Note

> For reverting back to a previous version don't create again version of step to revert back that it if i want to revert back from version 1 to version 9 then after successfull revert a version 10 will be created which will contain compressed revert of all the steps required to form from steps 9 to steps 1. This can be done possible by performing local revert of changed without storing it in database in each revert and updating to database finally only after a successful revert is done.
